**GENERAL**

Gradle command formats

.. code-block:: bash

	./gradlew command [-Penv={env}] [-Pmodule={module}]

+-----------+-------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+
|| Command  || Description                              || Env Options || Module Options |

+-----------+-------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+

Where `command` is one of:
- `build`
- `start`
- `stop`

Where `env` is one of:
- `authoring`
- `delivery`

And `module` is one of:
- `studio`
- `engine`
- `deployer`

**BUILD**

.. code-block:: bash

  ./gradlew build

The Gradle task above will:

#. Delete any existing environments
#. Download Apache Tomcat and Apache Solr (check the Gradle section on how to specified a version of Apache Tomcat an Apache Solr)
#. Build all Crafter CMS modules from the source (check the Git section on how to update the source)
#. Create the environment folders and copy all needed resources

	- ``crafter-auth-env``
	- ``crafter-delivery-env``

**START**

Starting an environment or a module using Gradle looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./gradlew start [-PmoduleName={module}] [-Penv={env}]

What this does under the hood is:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd crafter-{env}-env
  ./startups.sh

Both of those options will:

* Start Apache tomcat on default ports (8080,8009,8005) [See Gradle task on how to change default ports](#gradle-tasks)

* Start Solr server on port 8984

* Start Crafter Deployer on port

### 2.3 Distribute Crater CMS Live Environment

To Distribute a Crafter CMS Environment there is a task `livePack` that will generate a Zip and a Tar file with 
a **Clean** Live environment this means that it will trigger the `liveEnv` task and make sure that your distributable 
files are clean and ready to be un archive.

Archives will be saved in as `crafter-live-env.tar` and `crafter-live-env.zip` in the `distributables` folder
[Check the Gradle Tasks for more information about the livePack task](#4-gradle-tasks)


```bash
./grablew livePack

```

```

Both of those options will:

* Start Apache tomcat on default ports (9080,9009,9005) [See Gradle task on how to change default ports](#gradle-tasks)

* Start Solr server on port 8985

* Start Crafter Deployer on port
