Users/Groups Management
=======================

This section describes managing user accounts and groups.

A user is anybody who uses Crafter CMS.  A user account holds a user name and password.

A group consists of a collection of users.  Users can be assigned to a group for a certain site.  Through the groups, roles are assigned to users to certain areas of CrafterCMS (access rights/ permissions).  Each role represents a set of activities allowed.  Groups are  used to simplify management as changes made to the rights of the group applies to all the users belonging to tha t group.

Here's a list of predefined groups and roles in Crafter CMS:

Group            Role               Description/ Access rights

Admin            admin

Author           author

Developer        developer

Reviewer         reviewer

Publisher        publisher

You can add more groups defined whenever needed.  The list above is just a starting point for when you first create your site.  The following sections will give you more details on users and groups.
