Crafter CMS comes configured with default settings allowing us to run the available blueprints out of the box.  The default settings are a starting point but needs to be reviewed to verify if those settings are applicable to the experience being created.  Some of the settings that may be modified are related to features or system performance and others may be optional features.

This section contains information on how to configure the different settings in Crafter CMS. Changes to configuration settings are managed using Crafter Studio.

To access the configuration settings in Crafter Studio, click on **Site Config** in the Sidebar,
