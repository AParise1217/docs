Instructions for Upgrading Crafter CMS from 3.0.17 on Windows
=============================================================

For Crafter CMS installed from a bundle, before starting the upgrade process from 3.0.17, we need to download the updated scripts for the Crafter CMS environment we want to upgrade here: _put_zip_file_location_here.

Next, unzip the file we just downloaded ``ENV-3.0.17-batch-file-fixes.zip`` and copy the files under ``$CRAFTER_INSTALL\bin``.

Finally, follow the instructions here: :ref:`running-upgrade-script-from-current-install` to continue and finish your upgrade
