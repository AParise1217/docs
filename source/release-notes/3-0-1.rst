Crafter CMS 3.0.1
-----------------

^^^^^^^
Updates
^^^^^^^

* MS Windows Support
	* Updated Crafter CMS bundles to support MS Windows (7, 10, 2012 R2, 2016)
	* Updated Gradle to support build/deploy and run on Windows
* Self-updating Database Mechanics	
	* Studio can now detect the DB schema (3.0.0 vs 3.0.1) and upgrade it
	* Database table names have been updated to be more consistent/meaningful
* Dependency Calculation Enhancements
	* New dependency calculation and extraction mechanics (if upgrading from 3.0.0 you'll need to have the file: `config/studio/dependency/resolver-config.xml`)
* Blueprint Enhancements
	* Bug fixes and general enhancements. To make use of this, you'll need to stop `authoring` and remove the folder `craftercms/data/repos/global`, Studio will recreate with the updated blueprints. (That won't update already created sites.)
* Other updates
	* Added the integration testing suite right into Gradle, you can invoke it by calling `gradlew(.sh/bat) test`
	* Publishing troubleshooting guide (URL: http://docs.craftercms.org/en/3.0/system-administrators/studio/debugging-publishing-issues.html?highlight=publishing%20issues)

and lots of bug fixes :)
